# Software Architecture Roadmap #

The word “Architecture” is more related to the building design, planning, constructing or other structures to create a static piece of art.
The tangible part in software architecture is the end-user applications, used to manage data on the different app pages/screens. This tangible part of software architecture could be representing 20% (less or more) from the whole architecture, it is like iceberg. The rest of architecture lies in the hidden part, managing the backend tasks and the integration with other architectures to conform an endless ecosystem.  

While classic building architecture is relaying on a static infrastructure, the software architecture is relying on a dynamic and flexible infrastructure. Actually, this is not a comparison between building architecture and software architecture as both sharing one and important concept which is the main vocal point here and this concept is “making the design decisions to create a solution” the way still similar as blueprints still used to model the final artifact.

Is software architecture an art?
Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product, that involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas. (Wikipedia)

It is clear that software architecture is an art that requires talent and knowledge.

The art of software architecture still rising and still in the formalization stage. I mean there is no clear boundaries set for software architecture yet, but the significant impact of software architecture is clear for all of us as software products invading people life, creating new bonds, mixing reality and virtualization. It is making a change in people life.

What are the boundaries of software architecture?
Software products consist of three main parts:

1. Application – the tangible part used to manage the implementation of business use-cases, hide the technical complexity from the end-user and might integrate with remote software services. Almost, application consist of two parts: frontend app as a client; backend app as a service which manage data access and the integration with other services.
2. Data - information repos used by the application to retain business data.
3. Infrastructure - it could be either soft-infrastructure or hard-infrastructure, but lets say infrastructure here is meant by the minimum required software and hardware specs to get the application up and running on the client channles, backend services, and data services.
