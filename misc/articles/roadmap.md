# Software Architecture Roadmap #

The word “Architecture” is more related to the building or other civil structures to describe the design, planning, and constructing. creating a static piece of art.

The tangible part in software architecture is the end-user applications, used to manage data on the different app pages/screens. This tangible part of software architecture could be representing 20% (less or more) from the whole architecture, it is like iceberg. The rest of architecture lies in the hidden part, managing the backend tasks and the integration with other architectures to conform an endless ecosystem.  

While the classic building architecture is relaying on a static infrastructure, the software architecture is relying on a dynamic and flexible infrastructure. Actually, this is not a comparison between building architecture and software architecture as both sharing one and important concept which is the main vocal point here and this concept is “making a design decisions to create a solution” the way still similar as blueprints still used to model the final artifact.

## Software Architecture Art
Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product, that involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas. (Wikipedia)

It is clear that the software architecture is an art, which means it is requires talent and knowledge.

The art of software architecture still rising and still in the formalization stage. I mean there are no solid boundaries set for software architecture yet, but what is clear for us now is the significant impact of software architecture in our life by creating new bonds between us and the machines mixing the reality and virtualization. It is making a big change in people life.


## Architecture Views
To design an architecture, the architect will need to provide a design for one or more views which represent the perspective of understanding the architecture by specific sector of stakeholders (e.g. Client, Developers, Managers, IT engineers, etc.).
Each view is used at specific stage in Software Development Life cycle (SDLC) to create the final product.

The main views that can be used to describe:

1. Business - the business features and capabilities.
2. Application – the tangible part that used to manage the implementation of business use-cases, hide the technical complexity from the end-user and might be integrated with remote software services. Almost, application consist of two parts: frontend app as a client; backend app as a service which manage data access and the integration with other services.
3. Data - information repos used by the application to retain business data.
4. Infrastructure - it could be either soft-infrastructure or hard-infrastructure, but lets say infrastructure here is meant by the minimum required software and hardware specs to get the application up and running on the different solution tiers e.g. client channles, backend services, and data services.
