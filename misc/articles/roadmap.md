# Software Architecture Roadmap #

The word “Architecture” is more related to the building or other civil structures to describe the design, planning, and constructing. creating a static piece of art.

The tangible part in software architecture is the end-user applications, used to manage data on the different app pages/screens. This tangible part of software architecture could be representing 20% (less or more) from the whole architecture, it is like iceberg. The rest of architecture lies in the hidden part, managing the backend tasks and the integration with other architectures to conform an endless ecosystem.  

While the classic building architecture is relaying on a static infrastructure, the software architecture is relying on a dynamic and flexible infrastructure. Actually, this is not a comparison between building architecture and software architecture as both sharing one and important concept which is the main vocal point here and this concept is “making a design decisions to create a solution” the way still similar as blueprints still used to model the final artifact.

# The Concepts
in the following sections, I'll tell you some important concepts about architecture based on my work experience and what I have learnt about the architecture frameworks and methodologies. Some concepts like "Architecture Dimensions" are defined and used from to build a clear seen for what I a going to do and as a compass to my target. While, some other concepts are standard concepts already used in the software architecture community like "Architecture Views".

## Architecture Art

Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product, that involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas. (Wikipedia)

It is clear that the software architecture is an art, which means it is requires talent and knowledge.

The art of software architecture still rising and still in the formalization stage. I mean there are no solid boundaries set for software architecture yet, but what is clear for us now is the significant impact of software architecture in our life by creating new bonds between us and the machines mixing the reality and virtualization. It is making a big change in people life.

And, actually it is not only art, as there are a lot of things you have to learn when you get in touch with the real world of people, technologies, and culture so there is a need to learn from others and from your own experience as you go. Also, it is worth to learn the standard architecture frameworks and methodologies like TOGAF as a foundation for your way.   

## Architecture Dimensions

As mentioned early, I am using architecture dimensions to identify the boundaries and the target output (deliverables). 

The output of architecture process is determined by the dimensions of scope, view, and the level of details. These three dimensions formulate a wide range of architecture artifacts that can be delivered and by then emphasize the different architecture roles as per each target deliverable(s).

I am using these dimensions to allocate the target artifact in the architecture matrix, each dimension could be described as follows:

1. Scope - refers to the scope of architecture like organization , program , application , or it could be a specific scope in technology (e.g. platform, devops, infrastructure and network, azure, aws, etc.)

2. View - refers to the perspective of the architecture design like business view, logical view, application view, data view, physical view, and/or any other view which explain the idea of architecture from a specific point of view as per stakeholders matrix.

3. Details Level - refers to the level of details required for each architecture type and architecture view like high level details, low level details, or high level for some parts and low level for others as per each case.

That will be explained in detail in another article 

## Architecture Roles

There are many architectural roles that can be defined for software architecture. actually there are a wide range of shades when talking about the role of architect, and there is a cross-section between roles and each other too.

Lets take the benefit of architecture dimensions to identify the boundaries of different roles and their purpose. starting with "Scope" dimension which is the most clear dimension that can be used to describe the architecture roles, we can see that we have technology based roles, application based roles, program or industry based roles, and organization based roles. The other tow architecture dimensions are almost used to identify the anticipated output with each role.

I can categorize architecture roles under three main roles as follows:

1. Enterprise Architecture 
2. Solutions Architecture 
3. Technology Architecture 

What is worth to mention here is that the architect can move between roles or can play many roles, and that realy cause an issue to identify the role of architect inside the team or organization
