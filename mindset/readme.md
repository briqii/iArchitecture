# Principles 
Principles are the belief that lead the way of thinking and behavior. The quality of principles are affected by the learnt knowledge and experience.

Architecture principles is the constitution used to innovate and design a successful solution

**OpenGroup defined Principles as**:

Principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission.

# Knowledge
Facts, information, and skills acquired through experience or **education**

# Experience
practical contact with and observation of facts or events. 

# Content
Is the memory of iArchitecture which hold the the output of principles, knowledge, and experience.

The content is an storage to the artefacts of:
1. Principles - EA principles, application principles, integration principles, cloud native principles, data principles, etc.
2. Standards - it is related to the **knowledge** and represent the internal standards adopted by organization for different business and technical topics
3. Guidelines - it is related to the **knowledge** and represent the references required to learn or to implement some topic
4. Reference Architecture - it is related to the **experience** and represent the documentation for the optimal solution for the common business cases. the document is written as an optimal following-up to the principles, standards, and guidelines and provide the common technical solution for most of business use-case specially the physical and technology architecture views.     
5. Solutions - it is related to the **experience** and represent the issued documents as an architecture solution for a business requirements.
6. Assessments and Surveys - it is related to the **experience** and represent the assessment done over the delivered architecture solution to find the architecture gaps in the implementation to be covered in the next architecture iteration. this step is required to get sure that the architecture solution is practical and add value to the business stream, also make it evolutionary and resilient to change.     
7. Portfolio Registry - it is related to the **experience** and represent a traceability matrix for business, architecture solutions,and technologies.
