# Basic Principles

1. **Understand and validate business requirements** </br> Confirm and review business requirements with the stakeholders and highlight the assumptions and risks (with proposing a mitigation solutions)
2. **Build a beautiful and realistic architecture** </br> The solution should be aligned with business demands as much as possible. The target is to achieve business goals, and not to present impressive technical capabilities. at the end is the client and users are happy with the final artifact?
3. **Start Simple and Go Big** </br> As much as architecture composite of well-grand blocks as much as it could be started simple and grow big like plants
4. **Build a renewable architecture** </BR> Architecture solution is designed of substituted parts that can be replaced with new parts as we go.
5. **Keep it reusable** </br>  Reusable architecture building bocks makes it easy to compose a solution with already tried parts and keep window for innovation.  
6. **Design with hackathon spirit** </BR> Architecture solution is designed as if it was designed in the battlefield. That means, you have to be well prepared, unless the architecture will face beating.
7. **Break the rules to invent your way** </br> Sometime you have to break the rules that you have learned to provide a new way of innovation in case your current ways are not leading to an expected (or new innovated) results.
